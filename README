This github repository containes programs of Allan Variance calculation used in the paper "Optimization by Smoothed Bandpass Calibration in Radio Spactroscopy" by Yamake et al. (2012).

Contents:
asd.R			: R program to calculate Allan Variance
specResult.R	: R program to calculate baseline-calibrated spectra with the SBC and Conventional ON-OFF position switching scans.
specRMS.R		: R program to calculate standard deviations (SDs) in the resultant spectra
figure1.R		: R procedure to plot figures 
data_230.dat	: Spectral data for the temprate bandpass (942 kB)
data_36000.dat	: Spectral data for 10-hour (147.5 MB)

Usage:
1. Download all R scripts and data.
2. In the R console, set the working directory as
    setwd('THE_DIRECTORY_WHERE_FILES_ARE_DOWNLOADED')
3. Run the R script as
    source('figure1.R')

Then, figure*.pdf will be generated in the working directory.
